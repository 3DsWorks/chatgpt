# ChatGPT

This is a really simple ChatGPT console app written in c#

Create a new API Key here

Add your API Key to the Bearer token

It stores all your chats to My Documents\conversation.json 

That's pretty much the only reason I wrote it - to store my chats.

Doesn't know about context, so for that look at something like the python unofficial SDK or the Visual Studio Code plugin to ChatGPT

"Wrote" is an exageration. It's really simple and horrible until I get to play with it more.

LOL -  I just got ChatGPT to tidy up the code. Seriously, this is hilarous
